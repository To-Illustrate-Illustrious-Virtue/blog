It occurred to me that I should start a blog when I was brainstorming an introductory youtube video that I will be submitting as part  of a graduate school application.

The task is to introduce myself in 5 minutes. 
I've already explained my formal academic goals in my written statements, but I still
want to say something interesting in my video, something that represents who I am as a scholar


That's why I decided to write a mini-essay about çŽ©

And, oh, a mini-essay is really just a blog post
